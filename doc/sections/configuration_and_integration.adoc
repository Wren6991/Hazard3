== Configuration and Integration

=== Hazard3 Source Files

Hazard3's source is written in Verilog 2005, and is self-contained. It can be found here: https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/tree/master/hdl[github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl]. The file https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl/hazard3.f[hdl/hazard3.f] is a list of all the source files required to instantiate Hazard3.

For more information on the Verilog 2005 language, refer to IEEE 1364-2005 (a PDF can be found online).

Files ending with `.vh` are preprocessor include files used by the Hazard3 source. The following two are particularly noteworthy:

* https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl/hazard3_config.vh[hazard3_config.vh]: the main Hazard3 configuration header. Lists and describes Hazard3's global configuration parameters, such as ISA extension support
* https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl/hazard3_config_inst.vh[hazard3_config_inst.vh]: a file which propagates configuration parameters through module instantiations, all the way down from Hazard3's top-level modules through the internals

There are two ways to configure Hazard3 using these two files:

* Directly edit the parameter defaults in `hazard3_config.vh` in your local Hazard3 checkout (and then let the top-level parameters default when instantiating Hazard3)
* Set all configuration parameters in your Hazard3 instantiation, and let the parameters propagate down through the hierarchy

The latter method is recommended for mature projects because it supports multiple distinct configurations of Hazard3 in the same system (for instance, a high-performance applications core and a low-area control-plane core). You may find the former method more convenient for quick hacking on the configuration.

=== Top-level Modules

Hazard3 has two top-level modules:

* https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl/hazard3_cpu_1port.v[hazard3_cpu_1port]
* https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl/hazard3_cpu_2port.v[hazard3_cpu_2port]

These are both thin wrappers around the https://github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3/blob/stable/hdl/hazard3_core.v[hazard3_core] module. `hazard3_cpu_1port` has a single AHB5 bus port which is shared for instruction fetch, loads, stores and AMOs. `hazard3_cpu_2port` has two AHB5 bus ports, one for instruction fetch, and the other for loads, stores and AMOs. The 2-port wrapper has higher potential for performance, but the 1-port wrapper may be simpler to integrate, since there is no need to arbitrate multiple bus managers externally.

The core module `hazard3_core` can also be instantiated directly, which may be more efficient if support for some other bus standard is desired. However, the interface of `hazard3_core` will not be documented and is not guaranteed to be stable. By instantiating this module directly you are taking on the risk that future Hazard3 releases may be incompatible with your integration.

=== FPGA Synthesis

Hazard3 supports FPGA synthesis using tools such as Yosys. You should set <<param-RESET_REGFILE>> to zero, as FPGA block RAMs and LUT RAMs often do not support reset, or are limited in the types of reset they support. Setting <<param-RESET_REGFILE>> to one is likely to result in the register file being implemented with logic fabric flops, which has a significant area and frequency impact.

You should synchronise the `rst_n` reset input externally. An example reset synchroniser is included in the example SoC file, but the details depend on your FPGA synthesis flow and your platform-level reset requirements.

It's recommended to tie `clk` and `clk_always_on` to the exact same clock net to conserve global buffer resources. Clock gating _is_ supported on FPGA, but you must consult your toolchain documentation for the correct primitives or infererence techniques.

=== ASIC Synthesis

Hazard3 supports ASIC synthesis using common commercial tool flows. There are no particular requirements for configuration parameters, but your choice of configuration has an impact on area and frequency. Please raise an issue if you find a compatibility issue with your tools.

When applying the `clk_en` clock enable signal to the `clk` input in conjunction with the Xh3power extension, you must instantiate an external clock gate cell appropriate to your platform (such as an AND-and-latch type). Do not use a behavioural AND gate to gate the clock.

You must synchronise resets externally according to your STA constraints and your system-level reset strategy. Hazard3 uses an asynchronous active-low reset internally, but this can be adapted to other types by inserting an appropriate synchroniser in your core integration.

=== Interfaces (Top-level Ports)

Most ports are common to the two top-level wrappers, `hazard3_cpu_1port` and `hazard3_cpu_2port`. The only difference is the number of AHB5 manager ports used to access the bus: `hazard3_cpu_1port` has a single port used for all accesses, whereas `hazard3_cpu_2port` adds a separate, dedicated port for instruction fetch.

==== Interfaces Common to All Wrappers

[options="header",cols="1,1,3,4"]
|===
| Width | In/Out | Name | Description
4+| **Clock and reset inputs**
| 1          | In  | `clk`                        | Clock for all processor logic not driven by `clk_always_on`. Must be the same as the AHB5 bus clock. If the Xh3power extension is configured, you should instantiate an external clock gate on this clock, controlled by the `clk_en` output.
| 1          | In  | `clk_always_on`              | Clock for logic required to wake from a low-power state. Connect to the same clock as `clk`, but do not insert an external clock gate.
| 1          | In  | `rst_n`                      | Active-low asynchronous reset for all processor logic. There is no internal synchroniser, so you must arrange externally for reset assertion/removal times to be met. For example, add an external reset synchroniser.

When <<param-RESET_REGFILE>> is one, this input also resets the register file. You should avoid resetting the register file on FPGA, as this can prevent the register file being implemented with block RAM or LUT RAM primitives.
4+| **Power control signals**
4+| These signals are used in the implementation of internal sleep states as configured by the <<reg-msleep>> csr. They are used only when the Xh3power extension is enabled.
| 1          | Out | `pwrup_req`                  | Power-up request. Disconnect if Xh3power is not configured. Part of a four-phase (Gray code) req/ack handshake for negotiating power or clocks with your system power controller. The processor releases `pwrup_req` on entering a sufficiently deep `wfi` or `h3.block` state, as configured by the `msleep` CSR. It then waits for deassertion of `pwrup_ack` before taking further action.

The processor asserts `pwrup_req` when it intends to wake from its low-power state. It then waits for `pwrup_ack` before fetching the first instruction from the bus.
| 1          | In  | `pwrup_ack`                  | Power-up acknowledged. Tie back to `pwrup_req` if Xh3power is not configured, or if there is no external system power controller. The processor does not access the bus when either `pwrup_req` or `pwrup_ack` is low.
| 1          | Out | `clk_en`                     | Control output for an external top-level clock gate on `clk`. Active-high enable. Hazard3 tolerates up to one cycle of delay between the assertion of `clk_en` and the resulting clock pulse on `clk`.
| 1          | Out | `unblock_out`                | Pulses high when an `h3.unblock` instruction executes. Disconnect if Xh3power is not configured.
| 1          | In  | `unblock_in`                 | A high input pulse will release a blocked `h3.block` instruction, or cause the next `h3.block` instruction to immediately fall through.
4+| **Debug Module controls**
4+| All Debug Module signals should be connected to the signal with the matching name on the Hazard3 Debug Module implementation.
| 1          | In  | `dbg_req_halt`               | Debugger halt request. Tie low if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | In  | `dbg_req_halt_on_reset`      | Debugger halt-on-reset request. Tie low if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | In  | `dbg_req_resume`             | Debugger resume request. Tie low if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_halted`                 | Debug halted status. Asserts when the processor is halted in Debug mode. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_running`                | Debug halted status. Asserts when the processor is not halted and not transitioning between halted/running states. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
| 32         | In  | `dbg_data0_rdata`            | Read data bus for mapping Debug Module `dmdata0` register as a CSR. Tie to zeroes if debug support is not configured.
| 32         | Out | `dbg_data0_wdata`            | Write data bus for mapping Debug Module `dmdata0` register as a CSR. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_data0_wen`              | Write data strobe for mapping Debug Module `dmdata0` register as a CSR. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
| 32         | In  | `dbg_instr_data`             | Instruction injection interface. Tie to zeroes if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | In  | `dbg_instr_data_vld`         | Instruction injection interface. Tie low if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_instr_data_rdy`         | Instruction injection interface. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_instr_caught_exception` | Exception caught during Program Buffer excecution. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_instr_caught_ebreak`    | Breakpoint instruction caught during Program Buffer execution. Disconnect if debug support is not configured.
4+| **Shared System Bus Access**
4+| This subordinate bus port allows the standard System Bus Access (SBA) feature of the Debug Module to share bus access with the core. Alternatively, use the standalone `hazard3_sbus_to_ahb` adapter to provide dedicated SBA access to the system bus.
| 32         | In  | `dbg_sbus_addr`              | Address for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Tie to zeroes if this feature is not used.
| 1          | In  | `dbg_sbus_write`             | Write/not-Read flag for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Tie low if this feature is not used.
| 2          | In  | `dbg_sbus_size`              | Transfer size (`0`/`1`/`2` = byte/halfword/word) for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Tie low if this feature is not used.
| 1          | In  | `dbg_sbus_vld`               | Transfer enable signal for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Tie low if this feature is not used.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_sbus_rdy`               | Transfer stall signal for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Disconnect if this feature is not used.
| 1          | Out | `dbg_sbus_err`               | Bus fault signal for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Disconnect if this feature is not used.
| 32         | In  | `dbg_sbus_wdata`             | Write data bus for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Tie to zeroes if this feature is not used.
| 32         | Out | `dbg_sbus_rdata`             | Read data bus for SBA arbitrated with this core's load/store access. Disconnect if this feature is not used.
4+| **Interrupt requests**
| `NUM_IRQS` | In  | `irq`                        | If Xh3irq is not configured, this is the RISC-V external interrupt line (`mip.meip`) which you should connect to an external interrupt controller such as a standard RISC-V PLIC.

If Xh3irq is configured, this is a vector of level-sensitive active-high system interrupt requests, which the core's internal interrupt controller can route through the `mip.meip` vector. Tie low if unused.
| 1          | In  | `soft_irq`                   | This is the standard RISC-V software interrupt signal, `mip.msip`. It should be connected to a register accessible to M-mode software on your system bus. Tie low if unused.
| 1          | In  | `timer_irq`                  | This is the standard RISC-V timer interrupt signal, `mip.mtip`. It should be connected to a standard RISC-V platform timer peripheral (`mtime`/`mtimecmp`) accessible to M-mode software on your system bus. Tie low if unused.
|===

==== Interfaces for 1-port AHB5 CPU

This wrapper (`hazard3_cpu_1port`) adds a single standard AHB5 manager port. See the AMBA 5 AHB specification from Arm for definitions of these signals in the context of the bus protocol.

[options="header",cols="1,1,2,5"]
|===
| Width | In/Out | Name | Description
| 32 | Out | `haddr`      | Address output. AHB is always byte-addressed. Hazard3 always issues naturally-aligned accesses.
| 1  | Out | `hwrite`     | Driven high for a write transfer, low for a read transfer.
| 2  | Out | `htrans`     | Driven to `0` (`IDLE`) to indicate no transfer in the current address phase, and `2` (`NSEQ`) to indicate there is a transfer. Other types are not used.
| 3  | Out | `hsize`      | Driven to `0`, `1` or `2` to indicate byte, halfword or word sized transfers respectively. Other sizes are not used.
| 3  | Out | `hburst`     | Tied off to `0` (`SINGLE`). Hazard3 does not issue bursts.
| 4  | Out | `hprot`      | Bits `3:2` are always `0` to indicate nonbufferable and noncacheable access.

Bit `1` (privileged) is `0` for U-mode access, and `1` for M-mode and Debug-mode access.

Bit `0` is `0` for instruction fetch and `1` for data access (load/store or SBA).
| 1  | Out | `hmastlock`  | Hazard3 does not use legacy bus locking, so this bit is tied to 0.
| 8  | Out | `hmaster`    | 8-bit manager ID. A value of `0x00` indicates access from the core (including Debug mode access via the Program Buffer), and `0x01` indicates an SBA access. (Non-SBA Debug mode load/store access can be detected by checking the `dbg_halted` status.)
| 1  | Out | `hexcl`      | Asserts high to indicate the current transfer is an Exclusive read/write as part of a read-modify-write sequence. This can be disconnected if you have not configured the A extension, or if you do not require global exclusive monitoring (for example in a single-core deployment).
| 1  | In  | `hready`     | Negative stall signal. Assert low to indicate the current data phase continues on the next cycle.
| 1  | In  | `hresp`      | Bus error signal. You _must_ generate the complete two-phase AHB response as per the AHB5 specification.
| 1  | In  | `hexokay`    | Exclusive transfer success. Hazard3 always queries the global monitor, so tie this input *high* if you do not implement global exclusive monitoring (for example in a single-core deployment). Similarly, ensure your global monitor returns a successful status for non-shared memory regions such as tightly-coupled memories.
| 32 | Out | `hwdata`     | Write data bus. The LSB of the bus is always aligned to a 4-byte boundary. Hazard3 drives the correct byte lanes depending on the transfer size and bits `1:0` of the address. Remaining byte lanes have undefined contents.
| 32 | In  | `hrdata`     | Read data bus. The LSB of the bus is always aligned to a 4-byte boundary, so ensure you drive the correct byte lanes for narrow transfers.
|===

==== Interfaces for 2-port AHB5 CPU

This wrapper (`hazard3_cpu_2port`) adds two standard AHB5 manager ports, with signals prefixed `i_` for instruction and `d_` for data. See the AMBA 5 AHB specification from Arm for definitions of these signals in the context of the bus protocol.

The I port only generates word-aligned word-sized read accesses. It does not use AHB5 exclusives.

When shared System Bus Access (SBA) is used, the SBA bus accesses are routed through the D port.

[options="header",cols="1,1,2,5"]
|===
4+| **Port I (Instruction)**
| Width | In/Out | Name | Description
| 32 | Out | `i_haddr`      | Address output. AHB is always byte-addressed. This port always issues word-aligned accesses (address bits `1:0` are zero).
| 1  | Out | `i_hwrite`     | Always driven low for to indicate a read transfer.
| 2  | Out | `i_htrans`     | Driven to `0` (`IDLE`) to indicate no transfer in the current address phase, and `2` (`NSEQ`) to indicate there is a transfer. Other types are not used.
| 3  | Out | `i_hsize`      | Always driven to `2` to indicate a word-sized transfer. Other sizes are not used.
| 3  | Out | `i_hburst`     | Tied off to `0` (`SINGLE`). Hazard3 does not issue bursts.
| 4  | Out | `i_hprot`      | Bits `3:2` are always `0` to indicate nonbufferable and noncacheable access.

Bit `1` (privileged) is `0` for U-mode access, and `1` for M-mode and Debug-mode access.

Bit `0` is tied to `0` to indicate instruction fetch.
| 1  | Out | `i_hmastlock`  | Hazard3 does not use legacy bus locking, so this bit is tied to 0.
| 8  | Out | `i_hmaster`    | 8-bit manager ID. Tied to `0x00`.
| 1  | In  | `i_hready`     | Negative stall signal. Assert low to indicate the current data phase continues on the next cycle.
| 1  | In  | `i_hresp`      | Bus error signal. You *must* generate the complete two-phase AHB response as per the AHB5 specification.
| 32 | Out | `i_hwdata`     | Write data bus. Tied to all-zeroes as this port is read-only.
| 32 | In  | `i_hrdata`     | Read data bus. Valid on cycles where `i_hready` is high during non-`IDLE` data phases.
4+| **Port D (Data)**
| 32 | Out | `d_haddr`      | Address output. AHB is always byte-addressed. Hazard3 always issues naturally-aligned accesses.
| 1  | Out | `d_hwrite`     | Driven high for a write transfer, low for a read transfer.
| 2  | Out | `d_htrans`     | Driven to `0` (`IDLE`) to indicate no transfer in the current address phase, and `2` (`NSEQ`) to indicate there is a transfer. Other types are not used.
| 3  | Out | `d_hsize`      | Driven to `0`, `1` or `2` to indicate byte, halfword or word sized transfers respectively. Other sizes are not used.
| 3  | Out | `d_hburst`     | Tied off to `0` (`SINGLE`). Hazard3 does not issue bursts.
| 4  | Out | `d_hprot`      | Bits `3:2` are always `0` to indicate nonbufferable and noncacheable access.

Bit `1` (privileged) is `0` for U-mode access, and `1` for M-mode access.

Bit `0` is tied to `1` to indicate data access (load/store or SBA).
| 1  | Out | `d_hmastlock`  | Hazard3 does not use legacy bus locking, so this bit is tied to 0.
| 8  | Out | `d_hmaster`    | 8-bit manager ID. A value of `0x00` indicates access from the core (including Debug mode access via the Program Buffer), and `0x01` indicates an SBA access. (Non-SBA Debug mode load/store access can be detected by checking the `dbg_halted` status.)
| 1  | Out | `d_hexcl`      | Asserts high to indicate the current transfer is an Exclusive read/write as part of a read-modify-write sequence. This can be disconnected if you have not configured the A extension, or if you do not require global exclusive monitoring (for example in a single-core deployment).
| 1  | In  | `d_hready`     | Negative stall signal. Assert low to indicate the current data phase continues on the next cycle.
| 1  | In  | `d_hresp`      | Bus error signal. You _must_ generate the complete two-phase AHB response as per the AHB5 specification.
| 1  | In  | `d_hexokay`    | Exclusive transfer success. Hazard3 always queries the global monitor, so tie this input _high_ if you do not implement global exclusive monitoring (for example in a single-core deployment). Similarly, ensure your global monitor returns a successful status for non-shared memory regions such as tightly-coupled memories.

[[param-EXTENSION_A]]
===== EXTENSION_A

Support for the A extension: atomic read/modify/write. 0 for disable, 1 for enable.

Default value: 1

[[param-EXTENSION_C]]
===== EXTENSION_C

Support for the C extension: compressed (variable-width). 0 for disable, 1 for enable.

Default value: 1

[[param-EXTENSION_M]]
===== EXTENSION_M

Support for the M extension: hardware multiply/divide/modulo. 0 for disable, 1 for enable.

Default value: 1

[[param-EXTENSION_ZBA]]
===== EXTENSION_ZBA

Support for Zba address generation instructions. 0 for disable, 1 for enable.

Support for Zbs single-bit manipulation instructions. 0 for disable, 1 for enable.

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_ZBKB]]
===== EXTENSION_ZBKB

Support for Zbkb basic bit manipulation for cryptography.

Requires: <<param-EXTENSION_ZBB>>. (Since Zbb and Zbkb have a large overlap, this flag enables only those instructions which are in Zbkb but aren't in Zbb. Therefore both flags must be set for full Zbkb support.)

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_ZCB]]
===== EXTENSION_ZCB:

Support for Zcb basic additional compressed instructions

Requires: <<param-EXTENSION_C>>. (Some Zcb instructions also require Zbb or M, as they are 16-bit aliases of 32-bit instructions present in those extensions.)

Note Zca is equivalent to C, as we do not support the F extension.

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_ZCMP]]
===== EXTENSION_ZCMP
Support for Zcmp push/pop and double-move instructions.

Requires: <<param-EXTENSION_C>>.

Note Zca is equivalent to C, as we do not support the F extension.

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_ZIFENCEI]]
===== EXTENSION_ZIFENCEI

Support for the fence.i instruction. When the branch predictor is not present,
this instruction is optional, since a plain branch/jump is sufficient to
flush the instruction prefetch queue. When the branch predictor is enabled
(<<param-BRANCH_PREDICTOR>> is 1), this instruction must be implemented.

Default value: 0

[[cfg-custom-extensions]]
==== Custom Hazard3 Extensions

[[param-EXTENSION_XH3BEXTM]]
===== EXTENSION_XH3BEXTM

Custom bit manipulation instructions for Hazard3: `h3.bextm` and `h3.bextmi`. See <<extension-xh3bextm-section>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_XH3IRQ]]
===== EXTENSION_XH3IRQ

Custom preemptive, prioritised interrupt support. Can be disabled if an
external interrupt controller (e.g. PLIC) is used. If disabled, and
NUM_IRQS > 1, the external interrupts are simply OR'd into mip.meip. See <<extension-xh3irq-section>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_XH3PMPM]]
===== EXTENSION_XH3PMPM

Custom PMPCFGMx CSRs to enforce PMP regions in M-mode without locking. See <<extension-xh3pmpm-section>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-EXTENSION_XH3POWER]]
===== EXTENSION_XH3POWER

Custom power management controls for Hazard3. This adds the <<reg-msleep>> CSR, and the `h3.block` and `h3.unblock` hint instructions. See <<extension-xh3power-section>>

Default value: 0

==== CSR support

NOTE: the Zicsr extension is implied by any of <<param-CSR_M_MANDATORY>>, <<param-CSR_M_TRAP>>,
<<param-CSR_COUNTER>>.

[[param-CSR_M_MANDATORY]]
===== CSR_M_MANDATORY

Bare minimum CSR support e.g. <<reg-misa>>. This flag is an absolute
requirement for compliance with the RISC-V privileged specification. However,
the privileged specification itself is an optional extension. Hazard3 allows
the mandatory CSRs to be disabled to save a small amount of area in
deeply-embedded implementations.

Default value: 1

[[param-CSR_M_TRAP]]
===== CSR_M_TRAP

Include M-mode trap-handling CSRs, and enable trap support.

Default value: 1

[[param-CSR_COUNTER]]
===== CSR_COUNTER

Include the basic performance counters (`cycle`/`instret`) and relevant CSRs. Note that these performance counters are now in their own separate extension (Zicntr) and are no longer mandatory.

Default value: 0

[[param-U_MODE]]
===== U_MODE

Support the U (user) privilege level. In U-mode, the core performs unprivileged
bus accesses, and software's access to CSRs is restricted. Additionally, if
the PMP is included, the core may restrict U-mode software's access to
memory.

Requires: <<param-CSR_M_TRAP>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-PMP_REGIONS]]
===== PMP_REGIONS

Number of physical memory protection regions, or 0 for no PMP. PMP is more
useful if U-mode is supported, but this is not a requirement.

Hazard3's PMP supports only the NAPOT and(if <<param-PMP_GRAIN>> is 0) NA4
region types.

Requires: <<param-CSR_M_TRAP>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-PMP_GRAIN]]
===== PMP_GRAIN

This is the _G_ parameter in the privileged spec, which defines the
granularity of PMP regions. Minimum PMP region size is 1 << (_G_ + 2) bytes. 

If _G_ > 0, `pmcfg.a` can not be set to NA4 (attempting to do so will set the
region to OFF instead).

If _G_ > 1, the _G_ - 1 LSBs of pmpaddr are read-only-0 when `pmpcfg.a` is
OFF, and read-only-1 when `pmpcfg.a` is NAPOT.

Default value: 0

[[param-PMP_HARDWIRED]]
===== PMP_HARDWIRED

PMPADDR_HARDWIRED: If a bit is 1, the corresponding region's pmpaddr and
pmpcfg registers are read-only, with their values fixed when the processor is
instantiated. PMP_GRAIN is ignored on hardwired regions.

Hardwired regions are far cheaper, both in area and comparison delay, than
dynamically configurable regions.

Hardwired PMP regions are a good option for setting default U-mode permissions
on regions which have access controls outside of the processor, such as
peripheral regions. For this case it's recommended to make hardwired regions
the highest-numbered, so they can be overridden by lower-numbered dynamic
regions.

Default value: all-zeroes.

[[param-PMP_HARDWIRED_ADDR]]
===== PMP_HARDWIRED_ADDR

Values of pmpaddr registers whose PMP_HARDWIRED bits are set to 1. Has no effect on PMP regions which are not hardwired.

Default value: all-zeroes.

[[param-PMP_HARDWIRED_CFG]]
===== PMP_HARDWIRED_CFG

Values of pmpcfg registers whose PMP_HARDWIRED bits are set to 1. Has no effect on PMP regions which are not hardwired.

Default value: all-zeroes.

[[param-DEBUG_SUPPORT]]
===== DEBUG_SUPPORT

Support for run/halt and instruction injection from an external Debug Module,
support for Debug Mode, and Debug Mode CSRs.

Requires: <<param-CSR_M_MANDATORY>>, <<param-CSR_M_TRAP>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-BREAKPOINT_TRIGGERS]]
===== BREAKPOINT_TRIGGERS

Number of hardware breakpoints. A breakpoint is implemented as a trigger that
supports only exact execution address matches, ignoring instruction size.
That is, a trigger which supports type=2 execute=1 (but not store/load=1,
i.e. not a watchpoint).

Requires: <<param-DEBUG_SUPPORT>>

Default value: 0

==== External interrupt support

[[param-NUM_IRQS]]
===== NUM_IRQS

NUM_IRQS: Number of external IRQs. Minimum 1, maximum 512. Note that if
<<param-EXTENSION_XH3IRQ>> (Hazard3 interrupt controller) is disabled then
multiple external interrupts are simply OR'd into mip.meip.

Default value: 1

[[param-IRQ_PRIORITY_BITS]]
===== IRQ_PRIORITY_BITS

IRQ_PRIORITY_BITS: Number of priority bits implemented for each interrupt
in meipra, if EXTENSION_XH3IRQ is enabled. The number of distinct levels
is (1 << IRQ_PRIORITY_BITS). Minimum 0, max 4. Note that multiple priority
levels with a large number of IRQs will have a severe effect on timing.

Default value: 0

[[param-IRQ_INPUT_BYPASS]]
===== IRQ_INPUT_BYPASS

Disable the input registers on the external interrupts, to reduce latency by
one cycle. Can be applied on an IRQ-by-IRQ basis.

Ignored if <<param-EXTENSION_XH3IRQ>> is disabled.

Default value: all-zeroes (not bypassed).

==== Identification Registers

[[param-MVENDORID_VAL]]
===== MVENDORID_VAL

Value of the <<reg-mvendorid>> CSR. JEDEC JEP106-compliant vendor ID, or
all-zeroes. 31:7 is continuation code count, 6:0 is ID. Parity bit is not
stored.

Default value: all-zeroes.

[[param-MIMPID_VAL]]
===== MIMPID_VAL

Value of the <<reg-mimpid>> CSR. Implementation ID for this specific version of Hazard3. Should be a git hash, or all-zeroes.

Default value: all-zeroes.

[[param-MHARTID_VAL]]
===== MHARTID_VAL

Value of the <<reg-mhartid>> CSR. Each Hazard3 core has a single hardware thread. Multiple cores should have unique IDs.

Default value: all-zeroes.

[[param-MCONFIGPTR_VAL]]
===== MCONFIGPTR_VAL

Value of the <<reg-mconfigptr>> CSR. Pointer to configuration structure blob,
or all-zeroes. Must be at least 4-byte-aligned.

Default value: all-zeroes.

==== Performance/size options

[[param-REDUCED_BYPASS]]
===== REDUCED_BYPASS

Remove all forwarding paths except X->X (so back-to-back ALU ops can still run
at 1 CPI), to save area. This has a significant impact on per-clock
performance, so should only be considered for extremely low-area
implementations.

Default value: 0

[[param-MULDIV_UNROLL]]
===== MULDIV_UNROLL

Bits per clock for multiply/divide circuit, if present. Must be a power of 2.

Default value: 1

[[param-MUL_FAST]]
===== MUL_FAST

Use single-cycle multiply circuit for MUL instructions, retiring to stage 3.
The sequential multiply/divide circuit is still used for MULH*

Default value: 0

[[param-MUL_FASTER]]
===== MUL_FASTER

Retire fast multiply results to stage 2 instead of stage 3.
Throughput is the same, but latency is reduced from 2 cycles to 1 cycle.

Requires: <<param-MUL_FAST>>.

Default value: 0

[[param-MULH_FAST]]
===== MULH_FAST

Extend the fast multiply circuit to also cover MULH*, and remove
the multiply functionality from the sequential multiply/divide circuit.

Requires: <<param-MUL_FAST>>

Default value: 0

[[param-FAST_BRANCHCMP]]
===== FAST_BRANCHCMP

Instantiate a separate comparator (eq/lt/ltu) for branch comparisons, rather
than using the ALU. Improves fetch address delay, especially if `Zba`
extension is enabled. Disabling may save area.

Default value: 1

[[param-RESET_REGFILE]]
===== RESET_REGFILE

Whether to support reset of the general purpose registers. There are around 1k
bits in the register file, so the reset can be disabled e.g. to permit
block-RAM inference on FPGA.

Default value: 1

[[param-BRANCH_PREDICTOR]]
===== BRANCH_PREDICTOR

Enable branch prediction. The branch predictor consists of a single BTB entry
which is allocated on a taken backward branch, and cleared on a mispredicted
nontaken branch, a fence.i or a trap. Successful prediction eliminates the
1-cyle fetch bubble on a taken branch, usually making tight loops faster.

Requires: <<param-EXTENSION_ZIFENCEI>>

Default value: 0

[[param-MTVEC_WMASK]]
===== MTVEC_WMASK

MTVEC_WMASK: Mask of which bits in mtvec are writable. Full writability (except for bit 1) is
recommended, because a common idiom in setup code is to set mtvec just
past code that may trap, as a hardware `try {...} catch` block.


* The vectoring mode can be made fixed by clearing the LSB of MTVEC_WMASK
* In vectored mode, the vector table must be aligned to its size, rounded
  up to a power of two.

Default: All writable except for bit 1.
