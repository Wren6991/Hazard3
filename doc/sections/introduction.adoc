== Introduction

Hazard3 is a configurable 3-stage RISC-V processor, implementing:

* `RV32I`: 32-bit base instruction set
* `M`: integer multiply/divide/modulo
* `A`: atomic memory operations, with AHB5 global exclusives
* `C`: compressed instructions
* `Zicsr`: CSR access
* `Zba`: address generation
* `Zbb`: basic bit manipulation
* `Zbc`: carry-less multiplication
* `Zbs`: single-bit manipulation
* `Zbkb`: basic bit manipulation for scalar cryptography
* `Zcb`: basic additional compressed instructions
* `Zcmp`: push/pop and double-move compressed instructions
* Debug, Machine and User privilege/execution modes
* Privileged instructions `ECALL`, `EBREAK`, `MRET` and `WFI`
* External debug support
* Instruction address trigger unit (hardware breakpoints)

=== Architectural Overview

==== Pipeline Stages

The three stages are:

* `F`: Fetch
** Contains the data phase for instruction fetch
** Contains the instruction prefetch buffer
** Predecodes register numbers `rs1`/`rs2`, for faster register file read and register bypass
** Contains the address match logic for the optional branch predictor
* `X`: Execute
** Decodes and execute instructions
** Drives the address phase for load/store/AMO
** Generates jump/branch addresses
** Contains the read and write ports for the CSR file
** Unbypassed register values are available at the beginning of stage `X`
** The ALU result is valid by the end of stage `X`
* `M`: Memory
** Contains the data phase for load/store/AMO
** Generates exception addresses
** Register writeback is at the end of stage `M`

The instruction fetch address phase is best thought of as residing in stage `X`. The 2-cycle feedback loop between jump/branch decode into address issue in stage `X`, and the fetch data phase in stage `F`, is what defines Hazard3's jump/branch performance.

This document often refers to `F`, `X` and `M` as stages 1, 2 and 3 respectively. This numbering is useful when describing dependencies between values held in different pipeline stages, as it makes the direction and distance of the dependency more apparent.

==== Bus Interfaces

Hazard3 implements either one or two AHB5 bus manager ports. The dual-port configuration adds a dedicated port for instruction fetch. Use the single-port configuration when ease of integration is a priority, since it supports simpler bus topologies. Use the dual-port configuration for higher maximum frequency and greater clock-for-clock performance provided you either have a split (Harvard) bus architecture, or can handle multiple AHB5 managers on the same bus.

Hazard3 uses AHB5 specifically, rather than older versions of the AHB standard, because of its support for global exclusives. This is a bus feature that allows a processor to perform an ordered read-modify-write sequence with a guarantee that no other processor has written to the same address range in between. Hazard3 uses this to implement multiprocessor support for the A (atomics) extension. Single-processor support for the A extension does not require these additional signals.

AHB5 is one of the two protocols described in the https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5f91607cf86e16515cdc3b4b[AMBA 5 AHB protocol specification]. Its full name is (perhaps surprisingly) AMBA 5 AHB5. Refer to the protocol specification for more information about this standard bus protocol.

==== Multiply/Divide

For minimal M-extension support, as enabled by <<param-EXTENSION_M>>, Hazard3 instantiates a sequential multiply/divide circuit (restoring divide, naive repeated-addition multiply). Instructions stall in stage `X` until the multiply/divide completes. Optionally, the circuit can be unrolled by a small factor to produce multiple bits ber clock. A throughput of one, two or four bits per cycle is achievable in practice, with the internal logic delay becoming quite significant at four.

Set <<param-MUL_FAST>> to instantiate the single-cycle multiplier circuit. The fast multiplier returns results either to stage 3 or stage 2, depending on the <<param-MUL_FASTER>> parameter.

By default the single-cycle multiplier only supports 32-bit `mul`, which is by far the most common of the four multiply instructions. The remaining instructions still execute on the sequential multiply/divide circuit. Set the <<param-MULH_FAST>> parameter to add single-cycle support for the high-half instructions (`mulh`, `mulhu` and `mulhsu`), at the cost of additional logic delay and area.

The single-cycle multiplier is implemented as a simple `*` behavioural multiply, so that your tools can infer the best multiply circuit for your platform. For example, Yosys infers DSP tiles on iCE40 UP5k FPGAs. The multiplier is a self-contained module (in `hdl/arith/hazard3_mul_fast.v`), so you can replace its implementation if you know of a faster or lower-area method for your platform.
