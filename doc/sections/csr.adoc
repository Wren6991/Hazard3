== CSRs

The RISC-V privileged specification affords flexibility as to which CSRs are implemented, and how they behave. This section documents the concrete behaviour of Hazard3's standard and nonstandard M-mode CSRs, as implemented.

All CSRs are 32-bit; MXLEN is fixed at 32 bits on Hazard3. All CSR addresses not listed in this section are unimplemented. Accessing an unimplemented CSR will cause an illegal instruction exception (`mcause` = 2). This includes all U-mode and S-mode CSRs.


IMPORTANT: The https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf[RISC-V Privileged Specification] should be your primary reference for writing software to run on Hazard3. This section specifies those details which are left implementation-defined by the RISC-V Privileged Specification, for sake of completeness, but portable RISC-V software should not rely on these details.

=== Standard M-mode Identification CSRs

[[reg-mvendorid]]
==== mvendorid

Address: `0xf11`

Vendor identifier. Read-only, configurable constant. Should contain either all-zeroes, or a valid JEDEC JEP106 vendor ID using the encoding in the RISC-V specification.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:7 | `bank` | The number of continuation codes in the vendor JEP106 ID. _One less than the JEP106 bank number._
| 6:0 | `offset` | Vendor ID within the specified bank. LSB (parity) is not stored.
|===

==== marchid

Address: `0xf12`

Architecture identifier for Hazard3. Read-only, constant.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31 | - | 0: Open-source implementation
| 30:0 | - | 0x1b (decimal 27): the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/master/marchid.md[registered] architecture ID for Hazard3
|===

[[reg-mimpid]]
==== mimpid

Address: `0xf13`

Implementation identifier. Read-only, configurable constant.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:0 | - | Should contain the git hash of the Hazard3 revision from which the processor was synthesised, or all-zeroes.
|===

[[reg-mhartid]]
==== mhartid

Address: `0xf14`

Hart identification register. Read-only, configurable constant.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:0 | - | Hazard3 cores possess only one hardware thread, so this is a unique per-core identifier, assigned consecutively from 0.
|===

[[reg-mconfigptr]]
==== mconfigptr

Address: `0xf15`

Pointer to configuration data structure. Read-only, configurable constant.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:0 | - | Either pointer to configuration data structure, containing information about the harts and system, or all-zeroes. At least 4-byte-aligned.
|===

[[reg-misa]]
==== misa

Address: `0x301`

Read-only, constant. Value depends on which ISA extensions Hazard3 is configured with. The table below lists the fields which are _not_ always hardwired to 0:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:30 | `mxl` | Always `0x1`. Indicates this is a 32-bit processor.
| 23 | `x` | 1 if any custom extension is enabled (<<cfg-custom-extensions>>), otherwise 0.
| 20 | `u` | 1 if User mode is supported, otherwise 0.
| 12 | `m` | 1 if the M extension is present, otherwise 0.
| 2 | `c` | 1 if the C extension is present, otherwise 0.
| 0 | `a` | 1 if the A extension is present, otherwise 0.
|===

=== Standard M-mode Trap Handling CSRs

==== mstatus

Address: `0x300`

The below table lists the fields which are _not_ hardwired to 0:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 21    | `tw`  | Timeout wait. Only present if U-mode is supported. When 1, attempting to execute a WFI instruction in U-mode will instantly cause an illegal instruction exception.
| 17    | `mprv` | Modify privilege. Only present if U-mode is supported. If 1, loads and stores behave as though the current privilege level were `mpp`. This includes physical memory protection checks, and the privilege level asserted on the system bus alongside the load/store address.
| 12:11 | `mpp` | Previous privilege level. If U-mode is supported, this register can store the values 3 (M-mode) or 0 (U-mode). Otherwise, only 3 (M-mode). If another value is written, hardware rounds to the nearest supported mode.
| 7 | `mpie` | Previous interrupt enable. Readable and writable. Is set to the current value of `mstatus.mie` on trap entry. Is set to 1 on trap return.
| 3 | `mie` | Interrupt enable. Readable and writable. Is set to 0 on trap entry. Is set to the current value of `mstatus.mpie` on trap return.
|===

==== mstatush

Address: `0x310`

Hardwired to 0.


==== medeleg

Address: `0x302`

Unimplemented, as neither U-mode traps nor S-mode are supported. Access will cause an illegal instruction exception.

==== mideleg

Address: `0x303`

Unimplemented, as neither U-mode traps nor S-mode are supported. Access will cause an illegal instruction exception.

==== mie

Address: `0x304`

Interrupt enable register. Not to be confused with `mstatus.mie`, which is a global enable, having the final say in whether any interrupt which is both enabled in `mie` and pending in `mip` will actually cause the processor to transfer control to a handler.

The table below lists the fields which are _not_ hardwired to 0:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
|Bits | Name | Description
| 11 | `meie` | External interrupt enable. Hazard3 has internal custom CSRs to further filter external interrupts, see <<reg-meiea>>.
| 7 | `mtie` | Timer interrupt enable. A timer interrupt is requested when `mie.mtie`, `mip.mtip` and `mstatus.mie` are all 1.
| 3 | `msie` | Software interrupt enable. A software interupt is requested when  `mie.msie`, `mip.mtip` and `mstatus.mie` are all 1.
|===

NOTE: RISC-V reserves bits 16+ of `mie`/`mip` for platform use, which Hazard3 could use for external interrupt control. On RV32I this could only control 16 external interrupts, so Hazard3 instead adds nonstandard interrupt enable registers starting at <<reg-meiea>>, and keeps the upper half of `mie` reserved.

[[reg-mip]]
==== mip

Address: `0x344`

Interrupt pending register. Read-only.

NOTE: The RISC-V specification lists `mip` as a read-write register, but the bits which are writable correspond to lower privilege modes (S- and U-mode) which are not implemented on Hazard3, so it is documented here as read-only.

The table below lists the fields which are _not_ hardwired to 0:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
|Bits | Name | Description
| 11 | `meip` | External interrupt pending. When 1, indicates there is at least one interrupt which is asserted (hence pending in <<reg-meipa>>) and enabled in <<reg-meiea>>.
| 7 | `mtip` | Timer interrupt pending. Level-sensitive interrupt signal from outside the core. Connected to a standard, external RISC-V 64-bit timer.
| 3 | `msip` | Software interrupt pending. In spite of the name, this is not triggered by an instruction on this core, rather it is wired to an external memory-mapped register to provide a cross-hart level-sensitive doorbell interrupt.
|===

[[reg-mtvec]]
==== mtvec

Address: `0x305`

Trap vector base address. Read-write. Exactly which bits of `mtvec` can be modified (possibly none) is configurable when instantiating the processor, but by default the entire register is writable. The reset value of `mtvec` is also configurable.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
|Bits | Name | Description
| 31:2 | `base` | Base address for trap entry. In Vectored mode, this is _OR'd_ with the trap offset to calculate the trap entry address, so the table must be aligned to its total size, rounded up to a power of 2. In Direct mode, `base` is word-aligned.
| 0 | `mode` | 0 selects Direct mode -- all traps (whether exception or interrupt) jump to `base`. 1 selects Vectored mode -- exceptions go to `base`, interrupts go to `base \| mcause << 2`.
|===

NOTE: In the RISC-V specification, `mode` is a 2-bit write-any read-legal field in bits 1:0. Hazard3 implements this by hardwiring bit 1 to 0.

==== mscratch

Address: `0x340`

Read-write 32-bit register. No specific hardware function -- available for software to swap with a register when entering a trap handler.

==== mepc

Address: `0x341`

Exception program counter. When entering a trap, the current value of the program counter is recorded here. When executing an `mret`, the processor jumps to `mepc`. Can also be read and written by software.

On Hazard3, bits 31:2 of `mepc` are capable of holding all 30-bit values. Bit 1 is writable only if the C extension is implemented, and is otherwise hardwired to 0. Bit 0 is hardwired to 0, as per the specification.

All traps on Hazard3 are precise. For example, a load/store bus error will set `mepc` to the exact address of the load/store instruction which encountered the fault.

==== mcause

Address: `0x342`

Exception cause. Set when entering a trap to indicate the reason for the trap. Readable and writable by software.

NOTE: On Hazard3, most bits of `mcause` are hardwired to 0. Only bit 31, and enough least-significant bits to index all exception and all interrupt causes (at least four bits), are backed by registers. Only these bits are writable; the RISC-V specification only requires that `mcause` be able to hold all legal cause values.

The most significant bit of `mcause` is set to 1 to indicate an interrupt cause, and 0 to indicate an exception cause. The following interrupt causes may be set by Hazard3 hardware:

[cols="10h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Cause | Description
| 3 | Software interrupt (`mip.msip`)
| 7 | Timer interrupt (`mip.mtip`)
| 11 | External interrupt (`mip.meip`)
|===

The following exception causes may be set by Hazard3 hardware:

[cols="10h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Cause | Description
| 0 | Instruction address misaligned
| 1 | Instruction access fault
| 2 | Illegal instruction
| 3 | Breakpoint
| 4 | Load address misaligned
| 5 | Load access fault
| 6 | Store/AMO address misaligned
| 7 | Store/AMO access fault
| 11 | Environment call
|===

==== mtval

Address: `0x343`

Hardwired to 0.

==== mcounteren

Address: `0x306`

Counter enable. Control access to counters from U-mode. Not to be confused with <<reg-mcountinhibit>>.

This register only exists if U-mode is supported.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
|Bits | Name | Description
| 31:3 | -    | RES0
| 2    | `ir` | If 1, U-mode is permitted to access the `instret`/`instreth` instruction retire counter CSRs. Otherwise, U-mode accesses to these CSRs will trap.
| 1    | `tm` | No hardware effect, as the `time`/`timeh` CSRs are not implemented. However, this field still exists, as M-mode software can use it to track whether it should emulate U-mode attempts to access those CSRs.
| 0   | `cy`  |If 1, U-mode is permitted to access the `cycle`/`cycleh` cycle counter CSRs. Otherwise, U-mode accesses to these CSRs will trap.
|===

=== Standard Memory Protection CSRs

==== pmpcfg0...3

Address: `0x3a0` through `0x3a3`

Configuration registers for up to 16 physical memory protection regions. Only present if PMP support is configured. If so, all 4 registers are present, but some registers may be partially/completely hardwired depending on the number of PMP regions present.

By default, M-mode has full permissions (RWX) on all of memory, and U-mode has no permissions. A PMP region can be configured to alter this default within some range of addresses. For every memory location executed, loaded or stored, the processor looks up the _lowest active region_ that overlaps that memory location, and applies its permissions to determine whether this access is allowed. The full description can be found in the RISC-V privileged ISA manual.

Each `pmpcfg` register divides into four identical 8-bit chunks, each corresponding to one region, and laid out as below:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
|Bits | Name | Description
| 7   | `L` | Lock region, and additionally enforce its permissions on M-mode as well as U-mode.
| 6:5 | -   | RES0
| 4:3 | `A` | Address-matching mode. Values supported are 0 (OFF), 2 (NA4, naturally aligned 4-byte) and 3 (NAPOT, naturally aligned power-of-two). 1 (TOR, top of range) is not supported. Attempting to write an unsupported value will set the region to OFF.
| 2    | `X` | Execute permission
| 1    | `W` | Write permission
| 0    | `R` | Read permission
|===

==== pmpaddr0...15

Address: `0x3b0` through `0x3bf`

Address registers for up to 16 physical memory protection regions. Only present if PMP support is configured. If so, all 16 registers are present, but some may fully/partially hardwired.

`pmpaddr` registers express addresses in units of 4 bytes, so on Hazard3 (a 32-bit processor with no virtual address support) only the lower 30 bits of each address register are implemented.

The interpretation of the `pmpaddr` bits depends on the `A` mode configured in the corresponding `pmpcfg` register field:

* For NA4, the entire 30-bit PMP address is matched against the 30 MSBs of the checked address.
* For NAPOT, `pmpaddr` bits up to and including the least-significant zero bit are ignored, and the remaining bits are matched against the MSBs of the checked address.

=== Standard M-mode Performance Counters

==== mcycle

Address: `0xb00`

Lower half of the 64-bit cycle counter. Readable and writable by software. Increments every cycle, unless `mcountinhibit.cy` is 1, or the processor is in Debug Mode (as <<reg-dcsr>>.`stopcount` is hardwired to 1).

If written with a value `n` and read on the very next cycle, the value read will be exactly `n`. The RISC-V spec says this about `mcycle`: "Any CSR write takes effect after the writing instruction has otherwise completed."

==== mcycleh

Address: `0xb80`

Upper half of the 64-bit cycle counter. Readable and writable by software. Increments on cycles where `mcycle` has the value `0xffffffff`, unless `mcountinhibit.cy` is 1, or the processor is in Debug Mode.

This includes when `mcycle` is written on that same cycle, since RISC-V specifies the CSR write takes place _after_ the increment for that cycle.

==== minstret

Address: `0xb02`

Lower half of the 64-bit instruction retire counter. Readable and writable by software. Increments with every instruction executed, unless `mcountinhibit.ir` is 1, or the processor is in Debug Mode (as <<reg-dcsr>>.`stopcount` is hardwired to 1).

If some value `n` is written to `minstret`, and it is read back by the very next instruction, the value read will be exactly `n`. This is because the CSR write logically takes place after the instruction has otherwise completed.

==== minstreth

Address: `0xb82`

Upper half of the 64-bit instruction retire counter. Readable and writable by software. Increments when the core retires an instruction and the value of `minstret` is `0xffffffff`, unless `mcountinhibit.ir` is 1, or the processor is in Debug Mode.

==== mhpmcounter3...31

Address: `0xb03` through `0xb1f`

Hardwired to 0.

==== mhpmcounter3...31h

Address: `0xb83` through `0xb9f`

Hardwired to 0.


[[reg-mcountinhibit]]
==== mcountinhibit

Address: `0x320`

Counter inhibit. Read-write. The table below lists the fields which are _not_ hardwired to 0:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 2 | `ir` | When 1, inhibit counting of `minstret`/`minstreth`. Resets to 1.
| 0 | `cy` | When 1, inhibit counting of `mcycle`/`mcycleh`. Resets to 1.
|===

==== mhpmevent3...31

Address: `0x323` through `0x33f`

Hardwired to 0.

=== Standard Trigger CSRs

==== tselect

Address: `0x7a0`

Unimplemented. Reads as 0, write causes illegal instruction exception.

==== tdata1...3

Address: `0x7a1` through `0x7a3`

Unimplemented. Access will cause an illegal instruction exception.

[[debug-csr-section]]
=== Standard Debug Mode CSRs

This section describes the Debug Mode CSRs, which follow the 0.13.2 RISC-V debug specification. The <<debug-chapter>> section gives more detail on the remainder of Hazard3's debug implementation, including the Debug Module.

All Debug Mode CSRs are 32-bit; DXLEN is always 32.

[[reg-dcsr]]
==== dcsr

Address: `0x7b0`

Debug control and status register. Access outside of Debug Mode will cause an illegal instruction exception. Relevant fields are implemented as follows:

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:28 | `xdebugver` | Hardwired to 4: external debug support as per RISC-V 0.13.2 debug specification.
| 15 | `ebreakm` | When 1, `ebreak` instructions executed in M-mode will break to Debug Mode instead of trapping
| 12 | `ebreaku` | When 1, `ebreak` instructions executed in U-mode will break to Debug Mode instead of trapping. Hardwired to 0 if U-mode is not supported.
| 11 | `stepie` | Hardwired to 0: no interrupts are taken during hardware single-stepping.
| 10 | `stopcount` | Hardwired to 1: `mcycle`/`mcycleh` and `minstret`/`minstreth` do not increment in Debug Mode.
| 9 | `stoptime` | Hardwired to 1: core-local timers don't increment in debug mode. This requires cooperation of external hardware based on the halt status to implement correctly.
| 8:6 | `cause` | Read-only, set by hardware -- see table below.
| 2 | `step` | When 1, re-enter Debug Mode after each instruction executed in M-mode.
| 1:0 | `prv` | Read the privilege state the core was in when it entered Debug Mode, and set the privilege state it will be in when it exits Debug Mode. If U-mode is implemented, the values 3 and 0 are supported. Otherwise hardwired to 3.
|===

Fields not mentioned above are hardwired to 0.

Hazard3 may set the following `dcsr.cause` values:

[cols="10h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Cause | Description
| 1 | Processor entered Debug Mode due to an `ebreak` instruction executed in M-mode.
| 3 | Processor entered Debug Mode due to a halt request, or a reset-halt request present when the core reset was released.
| 4 | Processor entered Debug Mode after executing one instruction with single-stepping enabled.
|===

Cause 5 (`resethaltreq`) is never set by hardware. This event is reported as a normal halt, cause 3. Cause 2 (trigger) is never used because there are no triggers. (TODO?)

==== dpc

Address: `0x7b1`

Debug program counter. When entering Debug Mode, `dpc` samples the current program counter, e.g. the address of an `ebreak` which caused Debug Mode entry. When leaving debug mode, the processor jumps to `dpc`. The host may read/write this register whilst in Debug Mode.

==== dscratch0

Address: `0x7b2`

Not implemented. Access will cause an illegal instruction exception.

To provide data exchange between the Debug Module and the core, the Debug Module's `data0` register is mapped into the core's CSR space at a read/write M-custom address -- see <<reg-dmdata0>>.

==== dscratch1

Address: `0x7b3`

Not implemented. Access will cause an illegal instruction exception.

=== Custom Debug Mode CSRs

[[reg-dmdata0]]
==== dmdata0

Address: `0xbff`

The Debug Module's internal `data0` register is mapped to this CSR address when the core is in debug mode. At any other time, access to this CSR address will cause an illegal instruction exception.

NOTE: The 0.13.2 debug specification allows for the Debug Module's abstract data registers to be mapped into the core's CSR address space, but there is no Debug-custom space, so the read/write M-custom space is used instead to avoid conflict with future versions of the debug specification.

The Debug Module uses this mapping to exchange data with the core by injecting `csrr`/`csrw` instructions into the prefetch buffer. This in turn is used to implement the Abstract Access Register command. See <<debug-chapter>>.

This CSR address is given by the `dataaddress` field of the Debug Module's `hartinfo` register, and `hartinfo.dataaccess` is set to 0 to indicate this is a CSR mapping, not a memory mapping.

=== Custom Interrupt Handling CSRs

[[reg-meiea]]
==== meiea

Address: `0xbe0`

External interrupt enable array. Contains a read-write bit for each external interrupt request: a `1` bit indicates that interrupt is currently enabled. At reset, all external interrupts are disabled.

If enabled, an external interrupt can cause assertion of the standard RISC-V machine external interrupt pending flag (`mip.meip`), and therefore cause the processor to enter the external interrupt vector. See <<reg-meipa>>.

There are up to 512 external interrupts. The upper half of this register contains a 16-bit window into the full 512-bit vector. The window is indexed by the 5 LSBs of the write data. For example:

----
csrrs a0, meiea, a0 // Read IRQ enables from the window selected by a0
csrw meiea, a0      // Write a0[31:16] to the window selected by a0[4:0]
csrr a0, meiea      // Read from window 0 (edge case)
----

The purpose of this scheme is to allow software to _index_ an array of interrupt enables (something not usually possible in the CSR space) without introducing a stateful CSR index register which may have to be saved/restored around IRQs.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits  | Name   | Description
| 31:16 | `window` | 16-bit read/write window into the external interrupt enable array
| 15:5  | -        | RES0
| 4:0   | `index`  | Write-only self-clearing field (no value is stored) used to control which window of the array appears in `window`. 
|===

[[reg-meipa]]
==== meipa

Address: `0xbe1`

External interrupt pending array. Contains a read-only bit for each external interrupt request. Similarly to `meiea`, this register is a window into an array of up to 512 external interrupt flags. The status appears in the upper 16 bits of the value read from `meipa`, and the lower 5 bits of the value _written_ by the same CSR instruction (or 0 if no write takes place) select a 16-bit window of the full interrupt pending array.

A `1` bit indicates that interrupt is currently asserted. IRQs are assumed to be level-sensitive, and the relevant `meipa` bit is cleared by servicing the requestor so that it deasserts its interrupt request.

When any interrupt of sufficient priority is both set in `meipa` and enabled in `meiea`, the standard RISC-V external interrupt pending bit `mip.meip` is asserted. In other words, `meipa` is filtered by `meiea` to generate the standard `mip.meip` flag. So, an external interrupt is taken when _all_ of the following are true:

* An interrupt is currently asserted in `meipa`
* The matching interrupt enable bit is set in `meiea`
* The interrupt priority is greater than or equal to the preemption priority in `meicontext`
* The standard M-mode interrupt enable `mstatus.mie` is set
* The standard M-mode global external interrupt enable `mie.meie` is set

In this case, the processor jumps to either:

* `mtvec` directly, if vectoring is disabled (`mtvec[0]` is 0)
* `mtvec + 0x2c`, if vectoring is enabled (`mtvec[0]` is 1)

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits  | Name   | Description
| 31:16 | `window` | 16-bit read-only window into the external interrupt pending array
| 15:5  | -        | RES0
| 4:0   | `index`  | Write-only, self-clearing field (no value is stored) used to control which window of the array appears in `window`. 
|===

[[reg-meifa]]
==== meifa

Address: `0xbe2`

External interrupt force array. Contains a read-write bit for every interrupt request. Writing a 1 to a bit in the interrupt force array causes the corresponding bit to become pending in `meipa`. Software can use this feature to manually trigger a particular interrupt.

There are no restrictions on using `meifa` inside of an interrupt. The more useful case here is to schedule some lower-priority handler from within a high-priority interrupt, so that it will execute before the core returns to the foreground code. Implementers may wish to reserve some external IRQs with their external inputs tied to 0 for this purpose.

Bits can be cleared by software, and are cleared automatically by hardware upon a read of `meinext` which returns the corresponding IRQ number in `meinext.irq` (no matter whether `meinext.update` is written).

`meifa` implements the same array window indexing scheme as `meiea` and `meipa`. 

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits  | Name   | Description
| 31:16 | `window` | 16-bit read/write window into the external interrupt force array
| 15:5  | -        | RES0
| 4:0   | `index`  | Write-only, self-clearing field (no value is stored) used to control which window of the array appears in `window`. 
|===

[[reg-meipra]]
==== meipra

Address: `0xbe3`

External interrupt priority array. Each interrupt has an (up to) 4-bit priority value associated with it, and each access to this register reads and/or writes a 16-bit window containing four such priority values. When less than 16 priority levels are available, the LSBs of the priority fields are hardwired to 0.

When an interrupt's priority is lower than the current preemption priority `meicontext.preempt`, it is treated as not being pending. The pending bit in `meipa` will still assert, but the machine external interrupt pending bit `mip.meip` will not, so the processor will ignore this interrupt. See <<reg-meicontext>>.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits  | Name   | Description
| 31:16 | `window` | 16-bit read/write window into the external interrupt priority array, containing four 4-bit priority values.
| 15:7  | -        | RES0
| 6:0   | `index`  | Write-only, self-clearing field (no value is stored) used to control which window of the array appears in `window`. 
|===

[[reg-meinext]]
==== meinext

Address: `0xbe4`

Get next interrupt. Contains the index of the highest-priority external interrupt which is both asserted in `meipa` and enabled in `meiea`, left-shifted by 2 so that it can be used to index an array of 32-bit function pointers. If there is no such interrupt, the MSB is set.

When multiple interrupts of the same priority are both pending and enabled, the lowest-numbered wins. Interrupts with priority less than `meicontext.ppreempt` -- the _previous_ preemption priority -- are treated as though they are not pending. This is to ensure that a preempting interrupt frame does not service interrupts which may be in progress in the frame that was preempted.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits  | Name     | Description
| 31    | `noirq`  | Set when there is no external interrupt which is enabled, pending, and has sufficient priority. Can be efficiently tested with a `bltz` or `bgez` instruction.
| 30:11 | -        | RES0
| 10:2  | `irq`    | Index of the highest-priority active external interrupt. Zero when no external interrupts with sufficient priority are both pending and enabled.
| 1     | -        | RES0
| 0     | `update` | Writing 1 (self-clearing) causes hardware to update `meicontext` according to the IRQ number and preemption priority of the interrupt indicated in `noirq`/`irq`. This should be done in a single atomic operation, i.e. `csrrsi a0, meinext, 0x1`.
|===

[[reg-meicontext]]
==== meicontext

Address: `0xbe5`

External interrupt context register. Configures the priority level for interrupt preemption, and helps software track which interrupt it is currently in. The latter is useful when a common interrupt service routine handles interrupt requests from multiple instances of the same peripheral.

A three-level stack of preemption priorities is maintained in the `preempt`, `ppreempt` and `pppreempt` fields. The priority stack is saved when hardware enters the external interrupt vector, and restored by an `mret` instruction if `meicontext.mreteirq` is set.

The top entry of the priority stack, `preempt`, is used by hardware to ensure that only higher-priority interrupts can preempt the current interrupt. The next entry, `ppreempt`, is used to avoid servicing interrupts which may already be in progress in a frame that was preempted. The third entry, `pppreempt`, has no hardware effect, but ensures that `preempt` and `ppreempt` can be correctly saved/restored across arbitary levels of preemption.

| Bits  | Name        | Description
| 31:28 | `pppreempt` | Previous `ppreempt`. Set to `ppreempt` on priority save, set to zero on priority restore.  Has no hardware effect, but ensures that when `meicontext` is saved/restored correctly, `preempt` and `ppreempt` stack correctly through arbitrarily many preemption frames.
| 27:24 | `ppreempt`  | Previous `preempt`. Set to `preempt` on priority save, restored to to `pppreempt` on priority restore.

IRQs of lower priority than `ppreempt` are not visible in `meinext`, so that a preemptee is not re-taken in the preempting frame.
| 23:21 | -           | RES0
| 20:16 | `preempt`   | Minimum interrupt priority to preempt the current interrupt. Interrupts with lower priority than `preempt` do not cause the core to transfer to an interrupt handler. Updated by hardware when when `meinext.update` is written, or when hardware enters the external interrupt vector.

If an interrupt is present in `meinext`, then `preempt` is set to one level greater than that interrupt's priority. Otherwise, `ppreempt` is set to one level greater than the maximum interrupt priority, disabling preemption.
| 15    | `noirq`     | Not in interrupt (read/write). Set to 1 at reset. Set to `meinext.noirq` when `meinext.update` is written. No hardware effect.
| 14:13  | -           | RES0
| 12:4   | `irq`       | Current IRQ number (read/write). Set to `meinext.irq` when `meinext.update` is written.
| 3      | `mtiesave`  | Reads as the current value of `mie.mtie`, if `clearts` is set. Otherwise reads as 0. Writes are ORed into `mie.mtie`.
| 2      | `msiesave`  | Reads as the current value of `mie.msie`, if `clearts` is set. Otherwise reads as 0. Writes are ORed into `mie.msie`.
| 1      | `clearts`   | Write-1 self-clearing field. Writing 1 will clear `mie.mtie` and `mie.msie`, and present their prior values in the `mtiesave` and `msiesave` of this register. This makes it safe to re-enable IRQs (via `mstatus.mie`) without the possibility of being preempted by the standard timer and soft interrupt handlers, which may not be aware of Hazard3's interrupt hardware.

The clear due to `clearts` takes precedence over the set due to `mtiesave`/`msiesave`, although it would be unusual for software to write both on the same cycle.
| 0      | `mreteirq` | Enable restore of the preemption priority stack on `mret`. This bit is set on entering the external interrupt vector, cleared by `mret`, and cleared upon taking any trap other than an external interrupt.

Provided `meicontext` is saved on entry to the external interrupt vector (before enabling preemption), is restored before exiting, and the standard software/timer IRQs are prevented from preempting (e.g. by using `clearts`), this flag allows the hardware to safely manage the preemption priority stack even when an external interrupt handler may take exceptions.

The following is an example of an external interrupt vector (`mip.meip`) which implements nested, prioritised interrupt dispatch using `meicontext` and `meinext`:

=== Custom Memory Protection CSRs

[[reg-pmpcfgm0]]
==== pmpcfgm0

Address: 0xbd0

PMP M-mode configuration. One bit per PMP region. Setting a bit makes the corresponding region apply to M-mode (like the `pmpcfg.L` bit) but does not lock the region.

PMP is useful for non-security-related purposes, such as stack guarding and peripheral emulation. This extension allows M-mode to freely use any currently unlocked regions for its own purposes, without the inconvenience of having to lock them.

Note that this does not grant any new capabilities to M-mode, since in the base standard it is already possible to apply unlocked regions to M-mode by locking them. In general, PMP regions should be locked in ascending region number order so they can't be subsequently overridden by currently unlocked regions.

Note also that this is not the same as the "rule locking bypass" bit in the ePMP extension, which does not permit locked and unlocked M-mode regions to coexist.

| 15:0  | `m`      | Regions apply to M-mode if this bit _or_ the corresponding `pmpcfg.L` bit is set. Regions are locked if and only if the corresponding `pmpcfg.L` bit is set.

=== Custom Power Control CSRs

[[reg-msleep]]
==== msleep

Address: `0xbf0`

M-mode sleep control register. Resets to all-zeroes.

[cols="10h,20h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Bits | Name | Description
| 31:3 | - | RES0
| 2    | `sleeponblock` | Enter the deep sleep state on a `h3.block` instruction as well as a standard `wfi`. If this bit is clear, a `h3.block` is always implemented as a simple pipeline stall.
| 1    | `powerdown`    | Release the external power request when going to sleep. The function of this is platform-defined -- it may do nothing, it may do something simple like clock-gating the fabric, or it may be tied to some complex system-level power controller.

When waking, the processor reasserts its external power-up request, and will not fetch any instructions until the request is acknowledged. This may add considerable latency to the wakeup.
| 0   | `deepsleep` | Deassert the processor clock enable when entering the sleep state. If a clock gate is instantiated, this allows most of the processor (everything except the power state machine and the interrupt and halt input registers) to be clock gated whilst asleep, which may reduce the sleep current. This adds one cycle to the wakeup latency.
